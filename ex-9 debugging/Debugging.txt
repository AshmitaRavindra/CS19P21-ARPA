Debugging 
in debug dropdown:
Run file -> if more than one sequence then open the file we want to run and then give run file (OUTPUT IN OUTPUT PANNEL)
Run -> it will run the file name called Main.xml file
Debug -> step by step it will run
 
to slow the debug process -> go to debug in the top bar and click slow process 
if we want to have check marks and check each step then we can click execution tail and it will checkmark each step
if we want to stop in the middle of the execution then -> click break and then in locals panel we can edit by clicking in the pencil icon and then click continue and run it 
=> but not suitable to use break always -> we can use an option called (breakpoints)

=>(breakpoints)-> select the activity 
Click Type	Action				Result / Use Case
Single		Enable/Disable breakpoint	Toggle on/off without removing it
Double		Go to the activity		Quickly jump to where the breakpoint is set
Triple		Remove breakpoint		Delete the breakpoint completely

->> we can nest the sequence also and execute 

use of step into and step out 
Step Into: Pauses at every single activity, including inside containers.(pauses the activity)
Step Over: Executes the entire container, pausing only after it finishes.(it pauses the container and not the activity)
Step Out: Exits the current container and pauses at the next outer activity.



conditional breakpoint :--
breaks upon some condition
enable breakpoint for write line by right click and it would have toggled - then click edit breakpoint settings and give currentNumber>=60
and it will stop when the condition exceeds 
then clear the condition and give only hit cout as 3 and see 
then currentNumber = 33 and hitCount as 3 and see -> if an array contains more than 3 times 33 then because the hit count is 3 it will stop in the third time 33 appears
Hit Count lets you control how many times a breakpoint must be reached before the debugger actually pauses.


will come after adding breakpoint 
Locals panel -> to view the execution and changes happening 
Watch -> is like when we add the variable name it will give the type and value 
Immediate -> we can change the value by typing intFNo=20 like that we can change the value
